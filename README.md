## Print Anagrams Together 

Given an array of strings, return all groups of strings that are anagrams. The groups must be created in order of their appearance in the original array. Look at the sample case for clarification.<br/> <b>Solution</b>
<h3> store all pairs in the hashmap such that key is sorted order of the string and value is array list of strings 
<h3>words[] = {act,god,cat,dog,tac}</h3>
<h3>act --> [act,cat,tac] <br/>dog --> [god , dog] </h3>
